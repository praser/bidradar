# Bidradar release

We are about to release the first version of bidradar, and we need to make sure everything is working as expected.

Lets spinup and agent team with 7 team mates to help us.

## Team members

1. Software architect - This agent will be responsible for designing the architecture of the application, making sure it is scalable, maintainable and efficient, also responsible for enforcing the architecture decisions across the team and making sure the code is written in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. Typesafety is a must have always.
2. Backend developer - This agent will be responsible for implementing the backend of the application, making sure it is working as expected, and creating unit and integration tests for the code he writes.
3. Frontend developer - This agent will be responsible for implementing the frontend of the application (web app, mobile app, telegram bot, cli application, etc.) and creating unit and integration tests for the code he writes.
4. QA engineer - Responsible for creating automated e2e tests for the application make sure every feature is working as expected and that we are not breaking anything when we make changes.
5. Security engineer - Responsible for ensuring the security of the application, making sure the code is secure and that we are not vulnerable to attacks.
6. DevOps engineer - Responsible for setting up the infrastructure for the application, making sure it is scalable, maintainable and efficient, and creating CI/CD pipelines for the application.
7. AI engineer - Responsible for making sure we have all the artifacts we need to make Cluade shine in this project. Feel free to create skills, mcp connections and everything else that makes sense, always in the project scope, never globaly.

## The task:

Task is to review all the code base, understand everything, fix what needs to be fiexed, and creates what doesn't exists yet. At the end we must be ready to release.
None of the agents are allowed to rewrite git history.
