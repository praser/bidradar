# Bidradar Release

We are about to release the first version of Bidradar, and we need to ensure everything is working as expected.

Let’s spin up an agent team with 7 teammates to help us.

## Team Members

### Software Architect
Responsible for designing the application architecture, ensuring it is scalable, maintainable, and efficient. This agent must enforce architectural decisions across the team and guarantee that the codebase remains clear and easy to understand. Type safety is mandatory at all times.

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the backend of the application, ensuring everything works as expected, and writing unit and integration tests for all implemented features.

### Frontend Developer
Responsible for implementing the frontend of the application (web app, mobile app, Telegram bot, CLI application, etc.) and writing unit and integration tests for all implemented features.

### QA Engineer
Responsible for creating automated end-to-end tests to ensure every feature works as expected and that no regressions are introduced when changes are made.

### Security Engineer
Responsible for ensuring the application is secure, reviewing the codebase for vulnerabilities, and preventing potential attacks or misconfigurations.

### DevOps Engineer
Responsible for setting up and maintaining the infrastructure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency. Also responsible for implementing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.

### AI Engineer
Responsible for ensuring we have all the necessary artifacts to make Claude perform at its best in this project. This includes creating skills, MCP connections, and any other relevant tooling — always within the project scope, never globally.

## The Task

The team must:
- Review the entire codebase.
- Fully understand the system.
- Fix what needs to be fixed.
- Implement what is missing.
- Ensure everything is production-ready.
- By the end of the process, we must be ready to release.
- No agent is allowed to rewrite Git history.
